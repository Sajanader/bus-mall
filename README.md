this repo to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) so it manages the size and the aspect ratio of the images.

The appâ€™s purpose is to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, it is not allow any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.

The marketing team is not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. domo keeps track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.
